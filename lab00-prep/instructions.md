# Lab 0: Prep for the Semester

*Due: Monday, June 29, 2020 (today)*

Your assignment is to setup and do a few things to get ready for CSC 174.  

This lab won't get a grade by itself, but some of the things you do as part of Lab 0 will be graded separately as "participation."

## Step 1: Take the CSC 174 Poll

Just a quick poll to see what we're working with this semester

- Go to the [CSC 174 Polling Questions (Google Form)](https://forms.gle/aUJgRJtVw5Cyrakz8) and fill it out
- Due: Monday, June 29 (today)
- Graded: counts a participation

## Step 2: Access the CSC 174 Workspace in Slack

We will use Slack as our primary way to keep in contact with each other, and you'll use slack to get technical help (in lieu of attending a lab if we were meeting on campus)

- Go to [join.slack.com/t/csc174/signup](https://join.slack.com/t/csc174/signup) and setup your account (if you haven't already)

- Due: Monday, June 29 (today)
- Graded: counts a participation

## Step 3: Introduce Yourself 

In CSC 174 you will form teams to work on projects.  The best teams are made of students with technical skills that compliment each other.  You need to get to know the other students in CSC 174.

- Go to the **#chatter** channel in Slack
- Create a new message to introduce yourself; write whatever you want; minimally:
  - Your nickname, or how you like to be referred to if different from your *display name* in Slack
  - Your major
  - Any clubs or teams to which you belong
  - Your abilities in any of the following (which will be important to know later in CSC 174):
    - Literary/writing skills (yes! - this will be important in CSC 174!)
    - Graphic design skills
    - Programming or software development skills
    - Database skills
  - ...be sure to list courses you're taking or have taken related to these things^
- Due: Wednesday, June 29
- Graded: counts a participation

## Step 4: Localhost

- Reinstall a localhost on your computer (or ensure it's still working)
  - The professor will be using the product: **MAMP** or **MAMP for Windows** ([mamp.info](https://www.mamp.info/)), but you can use any web stack that has at least: **Apache**, **PHP**, and **MySQL**
  - If using **MAMP** or **MAMP for Windows** make sure both the green dots next to **Apache Server** AND **MySQL Server** are lit when you start the program (we'll be using MySQL in CSC 174)
- Find your files from CSC 170 (labs and projects) and move them into your **document root** (a.k.a. **web root**), into a subfolder named **csc170** (or something like that)
  - You'll need access to some of your old files in CSC 174
  - If you can't find your files, ask the professor; he archived (most) your files after your semester ended

- Due: Wednesday, June 29
- Not graded

## Step 5: Developer Roadmap

Later this week we'll have a live discussion in Zoom to talk about specific areas in front-end web development that may be of interest to you.  You need to prepare for this discussion.

- Go to the [Frontend Developer Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/frontend) and browse around.  Google terms and technologies that your unfamiliar with
  - You're not limited to what's shown on that particular *roadmap*.  Here's another one ([Web Development in 2020 - A complete roadmap](https://coggle.it/diagram/XfeRbWj7xy3dsEX8/t/web-development-in-2020)) that also comes with [its own YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBB1YtwODT0&t=29s)
- Go to the **#chatter** channel in Slack and mention some things you'd like to talk about on Friday
- Due: Wednesday, July 1
- Not graded
