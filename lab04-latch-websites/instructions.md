# Lab 4: LATCH Website

*Due: Friday, July 10, 2020* 

**The goal** of this lab is find websites that exemplify the use of Richard Saul Wurman's LATCH framework, and share them with everyone in CSC 174.

**The purpose** of this lab is simply to see as many LATCH framework examples as possible so you can use them as inspiration for your own ontologies you create for your websites.

- Find one example of each of Wurman's classes in the LATCH framework: location; alphabet; time; category; and hierarchy
  - Each example should have a major component of the website use one of the classes; i.e., not something simple like an alphabetical list in a pull-down menu; rather something like a full page of content, arranged in one of those classes
  - For each example, save the URL that points directly to what you want to demonstrate; maybe capture a few notes for each one so you remember what's what
- Be **prepared to present** your five examples to the class on Friday, July 10 during our 10:00 AM EDT live discussion Meeting via Zoom
  - You will be asked to share your desktop, so have your links and notes handy

## Notes

- The **professor will take attendance** during the Friday meeting and make a record of who presented their examples
- After the meeting, the professor will ask everyone to **submit their links and descriptions via Blackboard**
- Parts of the **grade for this lab** in Blackboard will include:
  - **Attendance, or a valid excuse**
  - Were you able to **present your examples** when called upon?
  - Were your **examples and descriptions good**? Did they demonstrate that you know the meaning of each of the classes in the LATCH framework?
- Note: if you cannot attend the live discussion on Friday, July 10 at 10:00 AM EDT for *any* reason, **send a DM to the professor in Slack** and provide the reason BEFORE the start of the meeting on Friday and explain why you can't make it.
- If you are excused from attending the live discussion, you will have to **watch 100% of the video** in Panopto within 24 hours
- After the meeting is complete and links/descriptions are submitted in Blackboard, the professor will combine all the examples and post them in a linked page of our Course Documentation Website
  - The idea here is: use these websites as inspiration for how you might architect your own content in new websites you build
