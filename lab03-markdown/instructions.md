# Lab 3: Markdown

*Due: Monday, July 6, 2020 (today)* 

**The goal** of this lab is to create a markdown document that demonstrates a lot of features of the language, by taking a previous HTML document (your webpage from Lab 2) and convert it as much as possible to a markdown document.

**The purpose** of this lab is simply to practice making a markdown document for the purpose so you see the value of using it, plus its limitations.

## Prep

- Take a look at the specifics of [Github Flavored Markdown (GFM)](https://github.github.com/gfm/) which we'll be using for each project in CSC 174, going forward.
  - Note: you don't have to know the whole thing; just learn how to format some common elements
  - Also, if the official GFM spec is a little too overwhelming, you can just Google for some tutorial or other information that purports to explain it well (BTW - if you find a good one, share it in our #chatter channel)
- Get your webpage from Lab 2; you will use that as source content

## Steps

1. Create a new markdown document using your first-initial and last name, e.g. **rkostin.md**
2. Manually convert your Lab 2 webpage to markdown, and try to replicate as much as you can using GFM
   - Obviously, you're limited as to what you can replicate in markdown; just try to do as much as possible without actually using HTML

## Requirements

- Everything that *could* be presented as markdown *should* be marked down 
  - I.e. do *not* just turn-in a plain, plain-text document (which technically *is* markdown); you have to try to use the features of markdown to demonstrate your ability
  - The point of this assignment is to take advantage of as many markdown features as possible, within reason
- Your markdown document must use the GFM standard and display normally and be easily readable using the GitHub website
  - No weird unintended formatting like monospace or unneeded indentations where it doesn't make sense, etc.
  - Beware using other software or online markdown programs; even if they say they support GFM they might not do it perfectly, so make sure your document looks correct in actual GitHub
- Your markdown document must contain **no** HTML!
  - Beware of online converters; if you use one, you need to clean-up the code manually
- Embedded images in your document must continue to work, using markdown syntax
  - Remember: you can link to your hosted images from Lab 2 without moving them to Lab 3!
- Hypertext in your document must continue to work, using markdown syntax

BTW - you can create an `.md` file directly in GitHub, online, in a repository.  While in a repository in GitHub, just click the "Create new file" button.  Be sure to name it using the **.md**  file extension.

## Submit the Lab

To get credit for your work:

- Your markdown document must be hosted in a GitHub repository.  It doesn't matter which one so long as it's public.  
  - Suggestion: since your content is related to Lab 2, you can put it in your Lab 2 repository ...anywhere, really
- Get the *direct* link (URL) to your **.md** file 
  - Test it to make sure it works and opens directly to your document
- Create a submission in Blackboard, in **Lab 3: Markdown** 
  - Paste the link to your **.md** file in the **Write Submission** area (*not* the comments box)
  - Also in the **Write Submission** area paste a link directly to **the HTML version** of your Lab 2 webpage (so I can compare the two)
