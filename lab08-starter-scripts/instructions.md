# Lab 8: Starter Scripts

*Due: Friday, July 24, 2020* 

As noted in the lecture videos, if this had been a "normal" semester, you would have worked on the initial database "starter scripts" in a lab on campus with the help of the professor and a bunch of TAs walking around, offering help as you go.  And then you would have shown us your progress in your localhost, and we would have given you lab credit at that time.

In our situation, I can't really look over everyone's shoulders to see if you did the actual work on your own localhost, but we can do the next best thing:

To get credit for your work:

- Simply compress (ZIP) your **intro-mysql2** folder and submit it in Blackboard in **Lab 8: Starter Scripts**

  In that compressed folder there should be the following files that resemble the code from the lecture videos...

  - **config.php**
  - **delete.php**
  - **insert.php**
  - **insert2.html**
  - **insert2.php**
  - **read.php**
  - **update.php**

  (the files: localhost.sql and testmysql.php are not required)
