# Lab 5: CSS Architecture

*Due: Friday, July 10, 2020* 

**The goal** of this lab is apply a CSS architecture methodology (any) to your Lab 1 website's CSS.

**The purpose** of this lab is to develop experience creating and using a CSS architecture, which will benefit you as you develop and extend the CSS you use in CSC 174.

## Steps

- Make a copy of your local **lab01** folder; call it **lab05**

- Learn and apply a CSS organization strategy to your Lab 5 website
  - Make sure the CSS still works; there shouldn't be any visual changes and the CSS should still validate normally (assuming it did so before)

Note: you only have to apply a CSS architecture to your own CSS; CSS from frameworks or plugins is not your responsibility

### Installation

- You must install the website on the class web server using the following web server credentials, below.

Note: **everyone will use the same FTP account**. Be careful *not* to disturb other students' files!

```
FTP Server (a.k.a. Hostname): ftp.csc174.org
FTP Port: 21
FTP Username: lab05@csc174.org
FTP Password: [same]
```

- When you FTP-in to the account, create a folder using your UR NetID (e.g. rkostin) and place your website in there
