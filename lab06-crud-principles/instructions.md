# Lab 6: C.R.U.D. Principles

*Due: Monday, July 13, 2020* 

**The goal** of this lab is apply use the CRUD page design principles to critique everyone else's Project 1 websites.

**The purpose** of this lab is to develop a critical eye in design, by finding shortfalls in existing websites and then being able to describe, in technical terms, what's wrong and how it could be improved.

*WARNING: this lab requires everyone to have a bit of a thick skin!  People will say things about your lovely design.  But keep in mind, it's all for the good!  This is how designers get better.*

## Requirements

- Everyone needs to **review the Project 1s** and make some design critiques and suggestions
  - Do <u>not</u> make *technical* suggestions, i.e. don't refer to CSS at all; just talk about the design principles based on visual inspection of the web pages
  - You need to make a total of **four design critiques/suggestions**; at least one for each of the four CRAP principles
  - You cannot make suggestions on a design that *you* created, however you *can* pick the Project 1 that you worked on, so long as you were not the creator of its design
  - Find all the Project 1s here: [csc174.org/project1](http://csc174.org/project1/)<br><br>

<hr>

1. Make a critique & suggestion for a place where **contrast** should have been used to highlight differences; <u>or</u> contrast removed to indicate similarity
2. Make a critique & suggestion for a place where **repetition** should have been used to unify different parts that followed a pattern; <u>or</u> repetition should have been broken to indicate that the parts were disparate
3. Make a critique & suggestion for a place where **alignment** should have been used to allow better flow (to increase comprehension) and unify the content; <u>or</u> elements should have been *mal-*aligned on purpose to purposefully slow-down or stagger the viewer to reduce flow (for purposes of making the viewer stop and think a bit)
4. Make a critique & suggestion for a place where **proximity** should have been used to show a connection (via closeness); <u>or</u> show difference (via distance)

NOTE: your critiques may be a matter of opinion and others may disagree with you.  That's okay!  It's more important to *have* an opinion and do your best to back it up using design principles.  

### Example Critique & Suggestion

To start everyone off, here's an example of a critique (with apologies to Adira, who came up with a GREAT design!)

- Website: **Los Angeles** ([csc174.org/project1/los_angeles](http://csc174.org/project1/los_angeles) ...see any sub-page)
- Principle: **Alignment**
- Critique: On each subpage, the horizontal position of everyone's photo seems to be "floating" somewhere to the right - not aligned with anything; alignment with something/anything would create a better vertical flow, i.e. it would make the photo seem more connected with the rest of the content
- Suggestion: the photos' left or right sides needs to be aligned with something/anything
  - Swap the photo and the list, so the left-side of the photo would be aligned with the left side of the content (and then the list would be aligned with the right-side of the photo)
  - OR align the right-side of the photo to the right side of the content.  <-- you can see this effect on very small viewport widths

*...okay, that was a very detailed example.  Yours doesn't have to be that long, but you get the idea.*

## Submit the Assignment

- Post your four critiques & suggestions in four separate posts in the new #lab6-critiques channel in Slack
