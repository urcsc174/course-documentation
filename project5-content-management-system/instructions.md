# Project 5: Content Management System

*Due: Friday, August 7, 2020 (with extensions upon request)*

**The goal** of this project is to start with an existing website (another team's Project 4) and apply a secure login system to protect certain functions of the website, so no one can create, update, or delete content without authentication.  

**The purpose** of this project is to work as a team to deliver a fully functional content management system, built by you and your team *without* the aid of an existing CMS framework (like WordPress).

## Establish a New City-Team

*NOTE: although it might appear that the focus of this project is on the **Technician**'s role, the roles of **Information Architect** and **Visual Designer** are equally important for the successful implementation of the authentication feature.*

*Also note that the entire Project 5 website (even the parts not related to the new feature) will be graded for proper architecture, design and technical implementation, so consider that when selecting a new city-team.*

*And (like Project 4), everyone will be graded for their individual contribution to the project - graded as individuals, not as a team ...so keep that in mind too!*

For this project, you need to choose your role: **IA**, **Visual Designer**, or **Technician**, and **a new city-team**.

- Go to [our shared Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z0z8gNCR0_-zW18ft0YDoiLPn6z4OTuAM5P8jVIa7cg/edit#gid=0)  and **copy** (do *not* move) your name/email from the **Project 4** city-teams to a *new* (different) city-team for **Project 5**
  - Your Project 5 city must be different than BOTH your Project 4 AND Project 3 city
- Then, establish contact with your new City-Team
  - When you have a team, follow the same steps as before to create a *new* private channel in Slack and invite the other members

## Requirements

*NOTE: at this time, it's expected you know ALL the steps and responsibilities for each role so they will not be listed in this instruction document.*  

The only things you need to know:

- **The #1 goal of this website:** present information about the students in CSC 174
- **The secondary goal of this website:** allow authenticated users to create, update, or delete information about the students
- **The process to create a new authenticated user** must *not* be accessible from the website at all; it needs to be a separate website (technically: just a webpage that's not linked from anywhere)
- The visual design of **the new user webpage** must use a CSS Framework and appear to *belong* to the website for which it creates new users

## Installation

- Use the following web server credentials (typically done by the technician):

Note: each team will use the same FTP account. Be careful *not* to disturb other teams' files.

```
FTP Server (a.k.a. Hostname): ftp.csc174.org
FTP Port: 21
FTP Username: project5@csc174.org
FTP Password: [same]
```

*Notice above: it's "5" in the username this time*

- When you FTP-in to the account, create a folder using the name of your **city-team** and place your website in there

## Submit the Project

*Everyone will be graded as individuals for Project 5.  Therefore everyone must make a submission in Blackboard to be graded.*

To get credit for your work:

- EVERYONE must make an assignment submission in Blackboard, in: **Project 5: Content Management System**
- In the **Write Submission** area (*not* the comments box):
  - **Your city-team name**
  - A list of **everyone's name** in your team (including your own) AND everyone's role
  - A **link to your team's website** on the class web server
  - NEW: a **link to your team's *new user webpage* - to create new users**  on the class web server
  - A **link to your team's repository** (which should be set to public)
