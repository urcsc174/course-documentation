# Lab 7: Page Layout

*Due: Wednesday, July 15, 2020* 

**The goal** of this lab is apply use of F-pattern and Z-pattern principles to create sketches of some webpage layouts ("comps" actually)

**The purpose** of this lab is to practice applying the page layout principles (Z-pattern and F-pattern) to a website that will be created later

## Requirements

This lab assignment requires you to draw, using any means with which you're comfortable, two web page layouts: one using an F-pattern; and another using a Z-pattern

For each design pattern, you need to create a **design comp** (*not* a wireframe!)  The intent of the comp is to be *as realistic as possible* without actually using HTML and CSS. 

- See [this article on the Lifewire website](https://www.lifewire.com/composite-comp-design-printing-1077995) to understand what's expected when creating a comp.  (Everything you need to know is in the section titled: **Comps in Graphic Design**)
- "As realistic as possible" is the goal, but it's understood that not everyone in CSC 174 has great skills in drawing or using illustration software - just do your best

- If you draw the **page layouts by hand** using paper, you'll need to take pictures of the pages; the pictures need to be good enough to clearly see your design intent
- If you draw the **page layouts using software**, you'll need to export the drawings to PDF

### F-Pattern Design

1. Briefly **review** everyone's personal webpages in all the Project 2s ([csc174.org/project2](http://csc174.org/project2/)); there are 21 in all
2. Come-up with a design and create a **sketch of a new webpage** that will link directly to everyone's personal webpage in Project 2 (21 students in CSC 174, so there will be 21 items, total); in effect, you're designing an index page for everyone in CSC 174
   - The design must **use the F-pattern** with each of the 21 items on its own horizontal line
   - The design must **use CRAP principles** as needed to convey meaning in the relationships among the elements
   - NOTE: this is a "comp" - you do *not* have to sketch 21 items nor use actual content; you can just use scribbles or *lorem ipsum* text and FPO images for a few of the 21 items; then indicate that there are more items using an ellipses ("...") or some other visual cue that the pattern continues
   - Remember to visually break-up the monotony of the F-pattern every 1,000 pixels or so (about 8 printed inches or so) ...be creative regarding how to do that ([here's example from the UX Planet website](https://uxplanet.org/f-shaped-pattern-for-reading-content-80af79cd3394#c759) ...BTW, that's a pretty good article about F-patterns if you need help)
   - As part of the design, **include a heading area** that represents the top-line of the F-pattern, then build-out the design using the IA described below
   - **Information Architecture**: below the heading area, each of the 21 items in the F-pattern must be accompanied by:
     - a heading
     - an excerpt
     - a photo
     - a link

### Z-Pattern Design

1. Come-up with a design and create a **sketch of a new webpage** (another "comp") that will welcome website visitors to the "2020 Fall Semester of CSC 174" website
   - The design must **use the Z-pattern**
     - The *primary goal* of the Z-pattern is to entice users to go to the CSC 174 student index page (your F-pattern webpage)
     - The *secondary goal* of the z-pattern is to allow CSC 174 students to login to their account
   - The design must **use CRAP principles** as needed to convey meaning in the relationships among the elements
   - Be creative regarding content and visual elements that will go in the *quadrants*; e.g. create a CSC 174 logo?  Or just use the UR seal, logo, or mascot?  ...it's up to you.
   - Don't forget to consider what will be the major center-piece of the Z-pattern - the "hero" (again, feel free to be creative)
   - If you need some help or hints, try Googling for suggestions (or just try this [article on the UX Design website](https://instapage.com/blog/z-pattern-layout))

## Submit the Assignment

- Post your image files and/or PDFs in the new **#lab7-page-layout** channel in Slack
  - Yes - everyone will see everyone else's handiwork; feel free to <s>steal shamelessly</s> ...erm, get inspiration
