# Lab 1: Initial Personal Website
*Due: Wednesday, July 1, 2020*

The goal of this assignment is to simply apply a lot of the basic skills you learned in CSC 170. 

## Requirements

For this assignment, you need to create a small website about yourself that meets some requirements.  

*NOTE: you do <u>not</u> need to include personal information.  You can make the website about your professional or academic career. (Think: portfolio that you can use as part of your job search.)*

Requirements:

- Use the **HTML5** and **CSS3** specifications and make sure **everything validates**, within reason
- At least **four web pages** with a common **navigation element** on each page
- The navigation element must **indicate the current page**
- Some use of **layout**
  - Center "floated" content within 85-95% of the viewport; constrained to keep it from growing any more than 1,000px wide
  - Some elements positioned side-by-side
- Use of some **advanced/fancy styling**; 
  - E.g. (as shown below) rotated and positioned text ...but not necessarily that.  There are lots of things you can do
  - What exactly constitutes "advanced" or "fancy" is up to you; do try! If you have questions or need help, leave a message in the #help channel in Slack
- Use of **custom fonts**
  - If you haven't had the pleasure yet, do try [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/); other sources of free custom fonts are available all over the web
- Use of **PHP Includes** to factor-out common elements into separate files
  - At the very least, the NAV element needs to be put into an Include file
- Other requirements: in addition to everything listed above^ all **web standards** and **industry best practices** must be used

*Example:* 

- You don't have to replicate this, but here are some ideas for inspiration: [csc174.org/lab01/rkostin](http://csc174.org/lab01/rkostin)
- Notice: you can FTP-into **lab01** (login credentials below) and navigate to the **rkostin** folder to see how I split the site into multiple Include files.  Again, you don't have to replicate that pattern, but feel free to be "inspired" by it.

You can use any solution to highlight the current page, but if need be you can always use [the professor's JavaScript plugin from CSC 170 (ZIP)](menu-highlighter.zip)

### Installation

- You must install the website on the class web server using the following web server credentials, below.

Note: **everyone will use the same FTP account**. Be careful *not* to disturb other students' files!

```
FTP Server (a.k.a. Hostname): ftp.csc174.org
FTP Port: 21
FTP Username: lab01@csc174.org
FTP Password: [see the #announcements channel in Slack]
```

- When you FTP-in to the account, create a folder using your UR NetID (e.g. rkostin) and place your website in there
